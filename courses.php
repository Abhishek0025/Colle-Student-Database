                                    Information Science is an inter-disciplinary field which is mainly concentrated on cognitive science, commerce, communication and management. The asset of an IS major lies in his/her ability to apply the knowledge of information systems and technology to help organizations compete more positively in the marketplace or to streamline present operations. As such, the IS professional might develop code for business transaction processing systems, client/server systems or end-user support systems; they might implement such systems in languages as COBOL, C++, Visual Basic or JAVA. IS graduates also design and administer databases and data warehouses, analyze and implement enterprise-wide solutions to information problems and manage telecommunications efforts. Also, IS graduates implement and manage corporate-wide intranets. Finally, IS graduates can also provide project management skills, technical writing or training by applying their knowledge of information technology and business processes.
